I was commissioned by an arts collective called Blind Ditch to do the research, UX, design and build for a digital archive of their 20 years of experimental performance and social art.

I had worked with Blind Ditch previously as a technologist on their Museum of Contemporary Commodities project. I was familiar with the type of work they create and the audiences and participants they tend to engage. 

This was one of the last projects I worked on as a 'one man band' and therefore one final exercise in doing all the parts of a design and development process individually. The challenges of working this way are mostly that you have to impose your own structure (process, deadline, standards) and that there is little collaboration with other designers. 

Self-imposed structure is something I've become accustomed to as a freelancer and that is reasonably well justified in the PDF case study below, which got me my current role at The National Archives ðŸ¥³.

The other challenge, **a lack of collaboration with designers**, gave rise to a working relationship with the client and users that was more involved and productive than a typical client and service provider setup. And, in fact, the loss of any specialised, 'professional design' collaboration was more than compensate by the attention paid to collaboration and the co-creation (of knowledge and designed outcomes). 

- Does this get replicated inside product teams? Do the relationships with users and stakeholders reach this point?
- Am i critiquing product teams? Or am I associating this type of environment with co-production and drawing on examples from recent co-design workshops with Hari? 

## Social sculpture

I have often reflected on why this was such a productive collaboration. I have had very similar positive experiences working as a collaborator/technologist on art projects in the past. In my opinion the common denominator is how artists create an environment for co-production. Admittedly, this will not be a universal truth, but still something I have since tried to simulate in whatever type of creative practice I participate in. Most of these projects had a significant social or participatory element to their outcomes, therefore the normal mode of operation is explicitly inclusive, with flat hierarchies and emphasises the social elements of the creative process. 

It reminds me of artist and teacher Joseph Beuys' idea of social sculptures. He saw the educational space as something shaped together by the ideas, actions and interactions within it. He would have a semi-prepared structure for his *lecture actions* and document them on a blackboard.

The classroom is a social space designed for learning where positive outcomes (learning, confidence, excitement) come from a certain amount of instability or uncertainty. Individual learners bring unknown experience and knowledge to these spaces and their participation determines an unknown outcome from the group and individuals. It's chaotic and exciting. 

Returning to the example of participatory art practice, my instinct is that there are a similar set of parameters and variables. There is a balance of intention and intentional openness, control and chance, that has emergent properties. 

## Control and chance

What does this have to do with design practice? Working in digital product design there are many, many ways that we try to orchestrate collaboration with each other and learning with our stakeholders. It is however unfortunately common that teams and institutions are not comfortable with this level of openness except in specific and sanctioned circumstances, like the occasional workshop. 

It is in the nature of artists be more comfortable with the unknown, to trust the process and see what emerges. 

Control and chance is a good description of the collaborative process and also how we learn. 

It has been one of my ambitions in my current role to capture the [[complexity of our service ecosystem|complexity of our service ecosystem]] but also to open up the creative process to a broader, more inclusive spectrum of people within and beyond the immediate team, as well as users and other stakeholders.  



I'm not convinced that there is a great deal of attention paid to the scenarios where we can learning and collaboration. They are far more balanced toward control and in my experience there is not enough intentional openness. Within the user research space there is nothing but openness


- Attempts to make space for this include design forums, design meetups and co-design

A combination of control and chance is a good description of the collaborative process and also how we learn. 

and to an even greater degree what the expectations are when we facilitate workshops or co-design sessions. Co-design is a slippery term that is over used in design projects to signal inclusion of some sort. 
To bring this back to design practice

effectively "that life is a social sculpture that everyone helps to shape". 

There is something maybe to naive 

There is no lack of efforts in the design, digital and UX arenas to forcibly encourage collaboration, and a lot of them are quite successful. 







Both education and truly co-creative work reminds me of the

Why build a micro-design system? 
* For many years working as an independent contractor I have found myself working mostly in established teams where design process is well established (albeit not always effective) or as an individual, sole design working direct to clients. In neither case is there much opportunity to build best practice from start
