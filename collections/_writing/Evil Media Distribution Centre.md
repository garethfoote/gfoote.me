[Evil Media Distributions Centre](http://www.transmediale.de/content/evil-media-distribution-centre-0 "Evil Media Distribution Centre") was an artistic response by [YoHa](https://web.archive.org/web/20191024033845/http://yoha.co.uk/ "YoHa") to the recently published book [Evil Media](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/evil-media "Evil Media | MIT Press") (2012) by Matthew Fuller and Andrew Goffey, which focusses on the pervasive presence of so-called “gray media” – an expanded notion of media or forms of mediation that provides a deeper, more complex understanding of their effects on how we act, perceive and think in our daily lives.

The artists invited 66 contributors to choose and write a short text about a gray media object (ranging from tampons to software compilers), and these texts and objects are then presented in the setting of a curiosity cabinet designed as a distribution centre.

My contribution to this project was a [short text on Compilers and Interpreters](http://yoha.co.uk/node/656).
