Iâ€™m a designer working at [The National Archives](), with a background in UX, interaction design, and coding in various languages. In the not-too-distant past I was a full time lecturer and course leader for an [undergraduate UX course](). 

[[./About|Read a little more about me]]. 

This is space for me to develop a regular writing practice about [subjects of interest](), show old and start new [experiments](), and write up [case studies]() of professional work.
